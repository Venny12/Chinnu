        My bava is kind of introvert. I am seeing him since I was born but never talked to me, neither him nor me.😂
        The first time, we spoke was on 22nd November, 2021. Since then, I got to know each and everything about him gradually
        and he is not at all a silent one😜. He is super caring, super naughty, and of course a super hoooman who
        got to know about me from then.
        He knows to how to handle my mood swings, we fight, we laugh, we eat, we talk. My cutie pie is soo sweet and master in handling my mood swings🥺💕.
        And our LDR, its a roller coaster with all mixed emotions. I know, Good Things Take Time.❤️😍😘
        Can't wait to be by his side and spend the entire life with my bangarammmmmm.
